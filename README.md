# AHK Scripts by mylakhana
This repository contains a bunch of ahk scripts to make everyday tasks easier to use. Each script contains description about it and the shortcuts included.

The files are intentionally left in .ahk extention rather than .exe so you could tailor them as you want.

All you need is AutoHotKey installed in your computer. You can get it from here: https://autohotkey.com/download/
